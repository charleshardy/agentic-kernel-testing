# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web GUI currently cannot display individual test cases after AI generation. Users can generate tests successfully, but cannot see, review, or manage the generated test cases in the interface. This feature will add comprehensive test case listing and management capabilities to the Web GUI.

## Glossary

- **Test Case**: Individual test generated by AI or submitted manually, stored in the system
- **Execution Plan**: A collection of test cases scheduled for execution
- **Web GUI**: The React-based dashboard frontend
- **Test Listing**: Display of individual test cases with filtering and pagination
- **AI Generation**: Automated test case creation from code diffs or function specifications

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view all test cases in the Web GUI, so that I can review and manage the tests that have been generated or submitted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the test execution page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all individual test cases
2. WHEN test cases are displayed THEN the system SHALL show test name, description, type, subsystem, and creation date
3. WHEN the test list loads THEN the system SHALL support pagination with configurable page sizes
4. WHEN multiple test cases exist THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by test type, subsystem, and status
5. WHEN a user clicks on a test case THEN the system SHALL display detailed test information including the test script

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test list to automatically refresh after AI generation, so that I can immediately see the newly generated test cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI test generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the test case list
2. WHEN the test list refreshes THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page and filter settings where possible
3. WHEN new test cases are added THEN the system SHALL highlight or indicate newly generated tests
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message without affecting the existing test list
5. WHEN multiple generations occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates without data loss

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage individual test cases from the Web GUI, so that I can edit, delete, or execute specific tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a test case THEN the system SHALL provide options to view, edit, delete, or execute the test
2. WHEN a user deletes a test case THEN the system SHALL remove it from the list and update the display
3. WHEN a user edits a test case THEN the system SHALL save changes and refresh the display
4. WHEN a user executes a test THEN the system SHALL create an execution plan and show progress
5. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL support selecting multiple test cases for batch actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the relationship between generated test cases and their source, so that I can understand what each test validates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test case was generated from a code diff THEN the system SHALL display the source diff information
2. WHEN a test case was generated from a function THEN the system SHALL show the function name and file path
3. WHEN displaying test metadata THEN the system SHALL include generation method, timestamp, and AI model used
4. WHEN viewing test details THEN the system SHALL show the original generation parameters
5. WHEN tests are auto-generated THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish them from manually submitted tests
