# Product Overview

## Agentic AI Testing System for Linux Kernel and BSP

An autonomous AI-powered testing platform that intelligently tests Linux kernels and Board Support Packages (BSPs) across diverse hardware configurations. The system leverages Large Language Models to generate test cases, analyze failures, and provide actionable feedback to developers.

### Core Capabilities

- **Autonomous Test Generation**: AI agents analyze code changes and automatically generate targeted test cases covering normal usage, boundary conditions, and error paths
- **Multi-Hardware Testing**: Execute tests across virtual environments (QEMU, KVM) and physical hardware boards to ensure compatibility
- **Intelligent Fault Injection**: Stress testing with memory failures, I/O errors, and timing variations to discover edge cases and race conditions
- **Root Cause Analysis**: AI-powered failure analysis that correlates issues with code changes and suggests fixes
- **Security Testing**: Automated fuzzing and static analysis to detect vulnerabilities before production
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance benchmarking with regression detection and profiling
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with version control systems and build pipelines

### Target Users

- Kernel developers validating code changes
- BSP maintainers ensuring hardware compatibility
- QA engineers discovering edge cases
- Security researchers identifying vulnerabilities
- Performance engineers tracking regressions
- CI/CD administrators automating testing workflows
